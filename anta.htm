<p class="pagecaption">Anta</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anta is one of the two twins. She is the magical engineer on the Antigoni.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born on Agtathryl, one of the poor outer edge cities. Her mother died when she was young and a local beggar chief took her and her sister in. They became beggars for his group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta and <a href="emly.htm">Emly</a> escaped from him by signing on with the Antigoni.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="emly.htm">Emly</a> and Anta are twins. They bicker constantly among themselves but are fiercely loyal to each other. For personalities think a mix of Ed from Cowboy Bebop and Ana and Uni Puma from Dominion: Tank Police.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta is intensely loyal to the Antigoni and her crew.</p>
