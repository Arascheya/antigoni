<p class="pagecaption">Andya</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Andya lost her family to civil conflict as Zerethaasa, the city they lived on, was converted from polytheism to monotheism. Her mother was Prelate Stevens sister. She fled to Agtathryl, where Stevens lives, rather than submit or die.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is angry when the ship is in port and in full rage mode if city officials are on the ship. Templars will send her running for her quarters and the weapons she keeps there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Andya is an expert with edged weapons and very good with ranged weapons. She learned these skills during the fighting in her city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the ship is away from port, she is the ship's clown, appears to take nothing seriously. This is her defense mechanism to keep anyone from getting too close. She doesn't want to feel what the death of her parents did ever again. Underneath, she is a very angry young woman, who would love to destroy the Templars in their entirety.</p>
