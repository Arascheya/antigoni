<p class="pagecaption">Arylys - Second Mate</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arylys was the last in a family of all girls. Her father is a shipping magnate on the spaceport city of Primolhm, named from being the primary home and first port to the world. Her father's company runs a fleet of transports within the Cluster Cities. Her father loves her, but he also views her as an asset for alliances. His plan was to marry her to the son of a rival house to form a stronger alliance. He would be furious if he learned she were working on a tramp freighter, taking Outer City traffic, and cooperating with Temple renegades. He wants her to return so he can further his plans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she approached marriageable age, she disguised herself as a man and signed on as crew on one of her father's ships. She was good enough that she worked up to learning navigation. She was a natural and had become quite good at it when her disguise was discovered. She fled rather than be taken back to her father. Learning navigation also gave her expertise in communications systems, weather observation, places where piracy is more likely, which cities are hard to deal with, and the working of the conveyor currents that ships and cities ride.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is extremely loyal to J'Anya because she is a woman, a captain, and she provided Arylys a way out of her situation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is introverted and uncomfortable when she is off the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arylys is asexual. Her only interests lie in finding friends she can trust and enjoy the company of. Once she feels safe with the crew, she will open up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She loves adornment and will wear as much as she can get away with in any situation.This may change after a few fights.</p>
