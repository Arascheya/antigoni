The new concept is that the expertise is divided into two pieces: _fluxcrafting_, which is the creation and manipulation of the interior of the basic flux machines via psychokinetics and visualization; and _structics_, the assembly of flux machines and other basic technologies to make best use of the flux cascade.

This means that fluxcrafting is a mystic discipline, that has consequences far beyond the determinism of true engineering. Any flux device has "character", which is an echo of the initial crafting and can be modified as a fluxcrafter goes inside. This creates issues of compatibility, and of likely behaviors.

This gives us a good division between Emly and Anta.

    - Anta is the fluxcrafter, the mystic, who repairs and makes flux devices.

    - Emly is the structician, building composite machines with craft and care.

Not that Anta doesn't know regular engineering -- she does. She can diagnose and fix an electrical circuit, weld a broken blade on an impeller, repair a complex mechanism. And not that Emly can't go into the fluxspace: she can, and she is as capable as most normal fluxcrafters when it comes to building and rebuilding, restroking, retuning, the internals of a flux device.

But Anta has a gift that Emly just doesn't have. Her fluxspace is immense and immensely structured, but a wonder of harmony and light. She can concentrate to a depth and intensity that most fluxcrafters can only dream about. Similarly, Emly is a much better practicing mechanic: she doesn't just know the theory, she is a grand intuitive mind and hand for diagnostics, building, and rebuilding. Some of her practical design choices set Anta reeling -- 

    >"Fuck," Anta breathed, "I just saw you do that and I still don't know how you did it. I would never have thought of that, not in a hundred days sitting and thinking and drawing diagrams."

Emly's keenest insights are external to flux; Anta's are within it.

The concept of a "struct" needs to be sorted.

    - Like in the preexisting document, except only "physical" within a fluxcrafter's workspace?
    - Or, is it the external assemblage?
    - How about this: the external assemblage is called an "assemblage", and one who works there is an "assembleur"? Then fluxcrafting is the general business of working with structs... and of mentally manipulating flux without structs! Fluxcrafting without structs is nowhere near as powerful, but can matter in an emergency.

So, Kori's initial premise -- that Emly is the engineer and Anta is the structician -- is unharmed. Just complex: everything has embedded flux devices. Emly's genius is to sense the qualities of the devices, and work them into the craftsmanship of a decidedly Steampunk Artificer's ethos.

A fluxcrafter's personal environment includes access to any flux device she is personally next to. It can also -- if the fluxcrafter is good enough -- include the structure of certain remote items she has worked on. This is called "Remote crafting", and is a special talent.

Fluxcrafter aptitudes:

    - stroking
    - harmonizing (an aural and usually vocal talent -- it can be very odd for someone watching a fluxcrafter work, to hear crooning or modulated whistling.)
    - quality sensing: a combination of smell, hearing, and visual perception of the colors in a... struct?


GLOSSARY

_Flux_ (to the stuffy, "Interstitial Flux"): Energy flowing into our universe, at which point it collapses into Native Energies.

_Aperture_: an opening between the universes, which allows Flux to pass through.

_Flux Device_: a solid material object into which an Aperture is embedded. This embedding a) prevents the aperture from instantly collapsing; and b) moderates the Flux, governing its rate of flow and the kinds of native energy into which it cascades.

_Cascade_: the process of transformation in which flux decays into native energy: heat, light, electrical potential, mechanical thrust or torque.

_Struct_: a managed flow of flux within the embed. A persistent spatial feature within the frame of reference of the flux device.

_Fluxcrafting_: the practice of psychokinetically directing flux.

_Structics_: the practice of working with structs. Both fluxcrafting and structics are done within a notional symbolic and visionary environment, the "fluxspace".

_Fluxspace_: the place in which mental and symbolic work with Flux occurs. Fluxcrafting is direct, transient, immediate, and not very powerful; structics is persistent, deferred, and capable of delivering great power.
