<p class="regtxt5">Zethara appears as a very pleasant, upbeat, and helpful woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zethara is a deep cover Temple spy. She was placed with the crew because <a href="janya.htm">J'Anya</a> came from an empty city and a family known for heresy. She has been ordered to remain in deep cover and report all actions of the ship and crew. These orders are to hold regardless of what is done until told otherwise by her handler.</p>
