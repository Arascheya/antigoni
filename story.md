# Notes on story

This is about the book of theory, and what it means.

 - The book comes to the Antigoni, and it's immediately a cause for concern.

   - The twins are digging into it, and if they actually unleash something, it's going to be a problem. They are amazingly good, but this is dangerous shit.

   - The book is contraband. The Templars will be after them.

Some establishing scenes need to be worked up: 

 - The Captain needs to be delineated as a badass. I feel kind of trapped: she is in a situation with the Templars where there isn't anything she can do. 

   - WHAT CONSTRAINTS ARE THE TEMPLARS UNDER?

   - Can it be non-Templar authority?

   - What about a confrontation with a competitor? With a cheating supplier?

 - Alternatively, what about someone on the crew who's a fixer? "I explained that they were making a mistake."
