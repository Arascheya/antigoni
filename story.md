# Notes on story

This is about the book of theory, and what it means.

 - The book comes to the Antigoni, and it's immediately a cause for concern.

   - The twins are digging into it, and if they actually unleash something, it's going to be a problem. They are amazingly good, but this is dangerous shit.

   - The book is contraband. The Templars will be after them.

Some establishing scenes need to be worked up: 

 - The Captain needs to be delineated as a badass. I feel kind of trapped: she is in a situation with the Templars where there isn't anything she can do. 

   - WHAT CONSTRAINTS ARE THE TEMPLARS UNDER?
     - Most powerful in the starport city
     - Power drops off the further away
     - attempting to expand power through whatever means necessary, force, coercion, diplomacy

   - Can it be non-Templar authority?

   - What about a confrontation with a competitor? With a cheating supplier?
   
   - Confrontation with twins previous "master"
     - cannot kill because of circumstances and witnesses
     - drives off, having made a serious enemy in this city
     - Templars in this city are of the diplomacy/cooperative nature with the populace
     - Templars not strong enough to ignore local politics, policing, and religions
     - Templars need unobserved conduit into and out of the city - thus the contract with the Antigoni

 - Alternatively, what about someone on the crew who's a fixer? "I explained that they were making a mistake."
