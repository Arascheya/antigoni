##Antigoni Voyages

### The Antigoni: Airship of Hexiaz


### The Antigoni Watches
Each watch section consists of:

 - A bridge officer


### Antigoni Crew

#### The Captain
A woman of middle years (~ 36 standard years). An extremely seasoned airshipman; one of the best pilots in the world.

 - Severely anti-religious

#### The First Mate
A man in his early 30s. A skilled airshipman and a competent technologist. In love with the Captain, although she is married to the ship. 

 - Deeply religious

 - Sort of a horndog, compensating for the Captain's lack of reciprocal affection.

#### The Second Mate
A woman in her mid 20s. Bisexual. Effective combat marksman.

#### Chief Engineers: Emly and Anta
Young girls, twins, prodigies with all things engineering. One is more of a magic-user, the other more of a structics technician.
