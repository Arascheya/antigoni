<p class="regtxt5">The ship drifted slowly closer to the city, floating at one of the lower levels of the Upside. The captain stared through bleary eyes at the approaching shape, waiting for the comm to show sufficient signal to call in an emergency docking. The first mate swayed beside her, as exhausted as she was, but without the tension of approach to keep him awake. Her voice cracked as she called engineering, "D'Esarra, can we make any more speed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Negative. All the warnings are red and the conntacters are smoking and arcing. We won't be able to hold this elevation much longer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The comm indicator turned green as she finished. The captain immediately switched it to approach and called, "Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is Deeps ship Antigoni requesting an emergency approach and docking. We have minimal steerage and boyancy. Request approach to the lowest and easiest access dock possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Bill to provide intro detailing arrival of ship, basic condition of ship, chameos by Dockmaster, Lead Templar, and one of the thugs - takes ship from arrival to docking - should include interactions with the dockmaster and the head of the templars */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins, Emly and Anta, were nearing the end of the docks. They hoped to find an airship that would hire them to do some simple work and pay them enough to meet their quota for the day. So far they had been turned away from every ship they had come across. They rounded the corner near the last docking cradle and were almost run over by a hurrying woman coming from the docked ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The docks in their city were small, having facilities that could only support small to medium sized cargo airships. They were located in the lower areas of the city, connected together by a series of walkways, cargo conveyors, and support services. This was standard design, to keep the ships from cluttering up the views from the upper reaches and to reduce collisions between ships and city structures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman was tall, with elaborate blonde braids of a style seldom seen since the city of T'Azjahdrath had returned from a conveyor that took it lower into the atmosphere with noone left in it. No trace of the citizens had ever been found. They had vanished without any notes, logs, or clues left behind. She had a squarish face, not young, but not old either, and intense blue eyes. She wore the heavy leather jacket favored by airship crews over a simple white tunic with elaborate collar stitching. She had been walking quickly toward the dockmaster's offices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pardon us," Anta started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was our fault," Emly continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should have been watching," Anta finished. They kept their eyes downcast in the perfect subservience expected in the city of Agtathryl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Missus Lady, where might we," Anta began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"find your captain?" Emly asked. The two were dressed identicaly in worn, baggy coveralls. Their hair was so dredded and dirty that the color could have been anything from dark brown to blonde.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She struggled against the desire to snarl as she said, "I am the captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two pairs of startled eyes jerked up to reveal dirty, hungry faces and shy smiles. "You are? Oh, that is so..." Emliy said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"wonderful! Would you let us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"fix things on your ship? We would..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"do engineering work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or food," Anta added after a long pause.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please Missus Captain. Anta knows the magic," Emly explained, pointing at her twin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And Emly knows the technology. We work..." Anta added, pointing at her twin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for cheap. Only enough to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hush, she doesn't need to know that!" Anta hissed in warning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain thought for long moments. Long enough for the girls to start shuffling from foot to foot, before she replied, "You can take a look. There are some minor things I could use done." Bright smiles greeted her announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took them aboard and led the way through the twisted, narrow passageways to engineering. She stood in the hatchway and watched as they quickly assessed the equipment. Muttered comments floated between them in the curious way they had. At last one looked up and listed off what the problems were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"By all means, please fix them." They were quicker and more thorough than her last engineer had been. They also cleaned up after themselves when they were finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now Missus Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if you could please pay us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we will be on our way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be in such a hurry. That was only the first test," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First test?" they asked in unison.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to see if you really could fix things before I asked you to look at the ship's lens system," she pointed to the magical lens mounted in its cradle. It was a crystaline lens shaped object about a meter in diameter, glowing with an inner greenish light. Contained in its center was the space distortion that provided a continuous source of the magical energy needed to power the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that what I think it is?" Emly asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta walked around it, staring into the depths of it, "It is, a servo lens."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We've only ever heard that these might exist..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Never seen one up close."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's the other one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come this way," the captain said. She led the way to a ladder mounted against the far wall of engineering. At the top was a pressure hatch, which she quickly spun open. Another ladder continued up into the boyancy section of the ship. A narrow catwalk threaded its way between the giant clear organo-crystaline bubbles that held the almost vacuum used for lift. Set mid way between the fore and aft of the ship was a larger lens, about six meters in diamter. It was mounted verticaly so its ceter point would be on a line running from the front of the ship to the rear. Numerous power pick-offs were attached to its face. The twins approached slowly, studying every aspect of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, this is so amazing!" Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can you tell us about it?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You tell me. Consider this the second test," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta walked around it on the narrow catwalks that granted access, "The structure is degrading. I'd say this lens has been used hard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And look at the power interfaces," Emly started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see them, twit," Anta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you didn't mention the arc scoring at the interface points," Emly snapped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No you weren't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was, but did you really look at this?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's different from what we've seen," Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's it from?" they asked, together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll tell you in a minute. What is your assessment of it?" the captain asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might last for years," Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or it might shatter the next time you load it," Anta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Replace it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We think you should replace it. The new one should be bigger," Anta announced.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least twenty percent more power," Emly added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The arc-burns are from trying to pull too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any lens that size would be at risk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you have so many power connections?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The ship was designed for speed and agility in the Deeps. Can you figure it out from that?" the captain asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, a Deeps ship..." Emly started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We've never seen one before..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Motors instead of spars?" Emly asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would explain the power connections," Anta answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the pressure hull. How high and how deep?" Emly asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how fast?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is about as high as I can climb with the power I have. She can make the Floor, if proper measures are in place. She goes fast enough," the captain answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are all Deeps ships like this?" they asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Only the fast attack ships and a few like this one. Now, whom do you work for?" They looked guiltily between each other, but didn't respond. "You can tell me. I might want to hire you if the price is right." Two brilliant smiles greeted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, don't worry about that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles dimmed. They looked at each other before one answered, "We work for a beggar chief. He sends us out and feeds us if we bring back money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Otherwise he shuts us in a dark room until the next day when we must try again." They stood, eyes searching the deck, refusing to meet the captain's look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, look, I can't pay you much. It would come to maybe the wage of a single journeyman's apprentice in the guild pay tables, but it's yours if you want it. I offer it in exchange for engineering services. This is the standard offer of at will employment. You may quit at any port, although prior notice would be appreciated. I can terminate your employment at will as well. Your duties will be the maintenance and upkeep of the magical and technological systems on this ship. Room and board come standard with this agreement," the captain explained as they made their way back to engineering.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Standard contract..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you think?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think we take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To the floor with him. If he doesn't like it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"he can go to the authorities!" They both laughed, then answered as one, "We'd love to Missus Captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And one other thing. It's not Missus Captain. It's just captain. I will not be bound to a husband."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When do we.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"start? M... uh...Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Immediately. You can move into your bunk space as soon as you wish. Your first tasks will be to keep the ship running. I don't have the resources to replace anything right now." She pointed to the small cabin off the engineering space. "I'd offer you better, but there really isn't any."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They darted over, surveyed the space, whistling appreciatively all the while. "It's great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A real door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Real beds!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's lovely, M..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain tried to see the cramped space, barely large enough for the bunks, a miniature table, wall lockers, and a chair, with the same eyes as the girls. The hatch still showed the blast marks from the time the drive control lens had blown up during the fight where she acquired the ship. She squinted and tried harder, trying to imagine the spaces they must be used to for this to be a palace. Finally she shook her head and gave up. "Glad you like it, because it's all I can offer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They argued quietly, deciding who would get the upper bunk, before emerging and starting an even more detailed exploration of the engineering spaces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain watched for a few minutes, then said, "If you are done for now, I should introduce you to the rest of the crew."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They glanced at each other, then at the captain, before mumbling a slow "OK."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain led them through more narrow passages, pointing to small doors leading to crew rooms, basic stores, and finally into the tiny galley and mess. The galley was well appointed, but everything was shoved in between structural members and other fittings. The mess had a small table, with enough places for six people to squeeze in at any one time. She flipped a switch on a small comm station near the door and spoke quickly, asking everyone to report to the mess.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two people slipped in, one at a tme. One was a woman, the other a man. "I'd like to introduce our new engineering team. Anta is a magical wizard and Emly is a technical savant." She pointed to the woman and said, "This is D'Esarra. She handles general crew duties and is the weapons officer. And this is M'Ardett, my first officer. They served with me when we were in the Deeps. I am J'Anya, the captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is this enough..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Crew to run the ship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">M'Ardett and the captain looked at each other, before the captain answered, "Only in an emergency. We need more crew, but we don't have money to pay them or know where to find them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd best tell them the rest," M'Ardett said quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was a disaster in the Deeps. A new business associate betrayed the rest of a consortium we were with and attacked us. Most of our crew died as a result. The last of us survived by bringing the ship to the city levels. We lost track of the others during the escape," J'Anya paused, then continued, "When we reached this city, we discovered our betrayer had been here first. We were very fortunate that the city watch did not believe all of the lies that were told."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The last week we have been making critical repairs. Antigoni can fly again, but there is so much more needing to be done," M'Ardett added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The plan is to move small, but valuable cargo between the cities in this area. Then use the cash to fund additional crew and repairs," the captain explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We might be able..." Anta started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We know some tricks..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We've seen ways that can automate..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Enough engineering and navigation tasks..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That smaller crews can operate a ship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This ship would be perfect..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For these improvements. The magic..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And systems you have get you very close."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would only take a few specific..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very specific, items to make it happen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How small a crew are we talking and how much would the components cost?" J'Anya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This number of people could do it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wouldn't be ideal..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Long watches, the need to double up..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Skills and expertise, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could survive even very long transits..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"With increased fatigue being the only..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Effect. As for cost..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We know a person..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He owes us for lots of help..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who would give us a very good deal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then we should go see him immediately!" J'Anya said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta started to whisper something to Emly, but stopped at her sister's head shake. J'Anya noticed it but decided not to push, instead, following them as they headed for the hatch to the docks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trip took them out of the docks and deep into the underside of the city. It was a mix of poor and poverty, rubbing together in a random mix of almost habitable spaces. The shelters were cobble together things, jammed into cracks and crevices in the city under structure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In what might have been the central plaza topside, things crowded together even closer in the under city. Anta led the way through a passage so narrow they had to walk sideways to get through it. At the end, she called thorugh a thick cloth drape, "Hello? It's Anta. Can we come in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," a low, raspy voice answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They walked into a tiny space, cluttered with old tools, half assembled bits and pieces, and an older man, slightly stooped and breathing with difficulty. "Captain J'Anya, this is..." Emly started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"T'Amoth, I know. It's been a long time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It has at that, young J'Anya. I haven't seen you since you ran away with that Deeps crew fifteen years ago. Captain now, eh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, have been for a while now. For a long time the Deeps were good to me. How about you? I thought you would have, have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Died with the rest? We would have, if we hadn't been visiting S'Aryh's family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is she, and your daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"S'Aryh is, is, oh to the Floor with it. She's all but captive, held so I will provide my skill only to Flernz, a local tough. And so I don't try to rescue K'Orinya from his clutches. I only see these two because they work for him." The twins looked at the deck and shuffled a bit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We only worked for him..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Until Mrs. Captain, uh the Captain offered us work on her ship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we are free," Emly proclaimed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't say that too loudly Ms. Emly. You know the passages have ears. But, I'm sure you didn't come to see me just for a social call."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were hoping..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We wanted to talk about..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The old automation magic you had."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never told you about that!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kind of obvious..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Its configuration wouldn't let it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be anything else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to know about it. What it would do, how it would work, and how much it would cost," J'Anya said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it works, it would allow a small crew to fly a fairly complex ship. I don't know if it works. It's old magic, very old. Someone brought it to me years ago, then disappeared before I could find out more. I have nothing I can test it on. As for cost, I would imagine it would be worth a fortune, or nothing. Being old, the Templars could slap a proscription on it and that would be that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, old friend," J'Anya said, turning to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"J'Anya, wait. I have a counter offer. K'Orinya knows cargos, values, and trade. That's why Flernz wants her. She wanted to fly, like you ran off to do, and started learning as soon as she could. She would be of great use to anyone trying to trade goods among the Outlier Cities, even in toward the Cluster Cities. You free my partner and daughter, the magic is yours. I'll help install it. I want to see it work. Then talk to my daughter. See if she could have a place on your crew. I want her away from the coming craziness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What craziness?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you never come Upside from the Deeps? The Templar expansions. There's a new council of bosses and they want their god to be the only one. They hold power in many of the Cluster Cities already. Now they want to extend into the Outliers as well, pushing out the local beliefs. What's worse, they want to take control of anything magical, especially the old magic. They claim its becuase it is tainted, but it feels more like a control grab."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And that's why I stayed in the Deeps. I hate city politics. It consumed every waking minute my parents had."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True, it did. But they were very good at it," a mist formed over his eyes for a moment, then he shook his head and continued, "Give my proposal some thought and let me know. Please don't take too long. Flernz is an unpredictible uggliness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have to talk to my crew. I can let you know very soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly led the way back toward the ship. As they passed a darker alleyway, half way to the docks, a voice called from the shadows. "Well, well, if it isn't Emly and Anta, my two favorite engineer girls. How are you my little gems? Made a new friend, I see. Did you forget about those of us waiting at home? Maybe you should introduce your new friend?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They froze in shock as a large figure stalked out next to them. His eyes narrowed slightly when J'Anya only stared at him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We..we.." Emly stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't need you any more. We are respectable now, working on the Antigoni and all," Anta stated bravely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anta..." Emly started in a warning tone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh my dear girls now don't be so selfish. You need to come home now. You'd never last on a ship anyway. I know your type." He smiled a wicked smile. "Does your new friend work on this ship as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd take it as a kindness if you released my engineers," J'Anya said, in a calm voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your engineers? You'd want these two scruffy half breed whelps of an unknown mother? Too bad. I claimed them first. They help provide for our poor family. Surely, you wouldn't deprive their siblings of the benefit they bring?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have a couple of thugs in the shadows, one to my left, and one almost behind me. Call them off or they won't be of much help to your 'family'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The large man started to puff up, until he saw the complete calm in her eyes. It deflated his certainty like a hot knife into a baloon. "This isn't over," he muttered as he faded back into the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, just..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow. How did you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've been in my share of fights. They wouldn't dare use slug throwers, it would draw Templars like flies on fresh meat. They could try knives, but I doubt they are as good as I am. Should I guess that is Flernz?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was. He won't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay backed down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. It does decide my course of action, though. Do you have any way to get a message to T'Amoth, or do we need to go back there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can get a message..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are dock runners that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are trustworthy. You can send..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One when we get back. Best to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not call attention to where we were."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll leave the arrangements to you," J'Anya said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the trip back to the ship was without incident. Anta disappeared for a few minutes, then returned to say the message was sent. "T'Amoth will find a way to get details to us. It may take a day or two, depending on how closely he is watched." It took J'Anya a moment to understand the message. She wasn't used to one of the twins speaking by herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya called the others of the crew and explained what the new arrangements were. "Are you seriously thinking about this? We know nothing of this guy, his crew, or the location." M'Ardett asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We will need to carefully look over the setup once we get more details. Yes, this is not good, but what other choices do we have? We are out of cash, with a partially fixed ship, and no way to hire the crew we would need to limp to another city," J'Anya replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta was about to speak when a voice echoed from the hatch to the docks, "Ahoy, Antigoni. May wecome aboard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya headed for the hatch at a half run. Six men in Templar uniforms stood on the dock, a seventh man stood at the hatch. "I'm very sorry to trouble you, ma... Captain J'Anya," he said, changing his greeting as he recognized the woman from the docking emergency several weeks previous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Prelate Stevens, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes captain. I'm afraid we have a complaint sworn out that your engineering team is smuggling contraband. We would like to take a look through your ship," Stevens answered, with very little hesitation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mind spun a moment, wondering how the twins could have smuggled anything before realization set in. "I assume you have the correct paperwork?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes captain. We have the warrants here. I took the trouble of making copies for your records." He pulled out a small stack of papers and handed it to her. She thumbed through it verifying everything was in order. Stuck in the bundle was a hand-written note asking her to meet him at Samyish Cloud Diner. "Everything in order?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," she replied, nodding slightly as she continued, "Come with me." She turned and motioned them inside. They followed her to the mess hall where the leader settled into a chair. J'Anya made quick introductions and then the rest of the crew slipped away into other parts of the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry about this captain. We believe this tip to be completely unfounded, still, we do need to check them all out." She led the way to the crew ladder up to the quarters and living areas. Once there the squad leader motioned for his men to sit. "How are the repairs going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Repairs?" She mumbled, still in shock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain, I'm going to level with you. We have gotten complaints from this source before. Every time they have been a waste of our effort. I thought we'd sit, have a bit of a chat, and then we'd report back. Although, we could search your ship if that would make you feel better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, we can talk. That's fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless there's something we would find. In that case, maybe we should search..." He moved as if to stand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. You wouldn't find anything." She managed to say in a calm voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good. We may be Templars, but we aren't stupid. This port sees a fair share of illicit cargo. As long as it isn't flagrant or part of the slave trade, we aren't that concerned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Repairs are going well, if slowly. We took a lot of damage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's good to hear. I think you were the target of one of the local toughs. He files complaints against ships that have come to his attention.

<p class="regtxt5">"I was with my engineers when we were acosted by a man that might fit your description. I could testify to his threatening us, if that would help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm not sure it would be enough. Some of the low-lifes here are quite influential. The system, well, it is the system, if you take my meaning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I fear I do. Some things just aren't easy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This city is more complicated than most. We are here to enforce laws and expand our influence. There is also a local guard that is supposed to protect the city, however, they are mostly in the pocket of the less desirables."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Templar glanced over at his men. "I think we've sat long enough. Have a good day captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly started, "Do you know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What cargoes have value? Where to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Find them?" They looked at each other, "Maybe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Possibly. Isn't good now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We might know someone..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That could help. There's a complication..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Trapped in bad place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">M'Ardett looked at the captain and asked, "Did you understand that?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think they said they know someone qualified as cargomaster, however, they are held against their will somewhere. Was that it?" Two brilliant smiles met her statement. "What should we expect if we were to attempt a rescue?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't be serious, J'Anya!" M'Ardett protested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? We've been trying to find crew the traditional way and none of them has stayed to interview once they see a woman captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't want any troublefrom local authorities. Who knows what lies the Ashtrakahn crew told when they were here," M'Ardett tried again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If they said anything, we'd already be in trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Local Templars..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't so bad. Mostly..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fair and courtious. Too few..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To impose their more nasty edicts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What should we expect?" the captain asked again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Old T'Arnis is secure in his hold..." Anta started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So there won't be a lot of guards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"K'Orinya is kept under light guiard. She can't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Run because the docks are crawling with those loyal to T'Arnis."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That doesn't sound very simple. How are we supposed to get her on the ship?" M'Ardett asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Engineering supplies. We know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A supplier who would help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He owes us for work we did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">M'Ardett was shaking his head as Emly finished. "J'Anya, you can't be seriously considering this. If this local thug has people watching the docks, chances are he also has people in the Templars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But he doesn't," Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The local boss is rare..." Emly continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's one of the few..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honorable, honest Templars. Spies don't last..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"T'Arnis has tried..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Many times, and failed every time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When is the best time to get her out?" J'Anya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first part of the rescue goes here - work out details */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* communication - magic based, degrading on hexiaz as te hexen life forms begin to stir in the Deeps and effect the Upside, someone could mention communications degrading of late, far worse than ever before, this would allow communications to still work in places that are not hexiaz */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">A figure watched from the shadows as a group left the Antigoni and disappeared into the maze of the docks. It watched for long minutes lobger, until there was no motion around the ship, then darted for the hatch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* second part of rescue and return to ship goes here */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* remember can move in and out of wind currents at various levels for changing course */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they made no move to leave, the captain asked, "Don't you need to get your things? I am hoping to get cargo and be gone by late tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Downcast looks met her gaze. "We don't have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything. Just another set of clothes..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back, back there..." Anta ended with a shudder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can pay you for the work you did today and advance you a small amount of the salary so you can get essentials," the captain said slowly. Relieved smiles greeted her announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later they headed off the ship, toward the shops near the docks. The dock area was a maze of storage buildings, unloading equipment, narrow alleys and passages, and shops catering to the needs of ships and their crews.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shopping didn't take them long, between minimal needs and minimal cash, there was no need to make an adventure out of it. They changed into one of their new sets of clothes in a restroom near the cluster of shops and dumped their tattered old stuff in the nearest waste bin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they passed a darker alleyway a voice called from the shadows. "Well, well, if it isn't Emly and Anta, my two favorite engineer girls. How are you my little gems? New clothes I see. And you look well-fed. Did you forget about those of us waiting at home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They froze in shock as a large figure stalked out next to them. Huge hands reached out and grabbed their shoulders and squeezed painfully. "Well, it's no matter. I have found you. Now you can share the wealth the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We..we.." Emly stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't need you any more. We are respectable now, working on the Antigoni and all," Anta stated bravely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anta..." Emly started in a warning tone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh my dear girls now don't be so selfish. You need to come home now. You'd never last on a ship anyway. I know your type." He smiled a wicked smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Help, rape. Help, someone." Anta screamed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why you..." the man dropped his hand from Emly's shoulder and cocked back a fist. Before he could strike Anta he heard shouts and whistles from up the street. His hand dropped from Anta's shoulder as he hissed, "This isn't over." Then he melted back into the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A moment later a Templar slid to a halt in front of them. "Are you ok?" They nodded, still shaken. "What happened?" He listened intently while they told him an abreviated story of the encounter. "We've had complaints like this before. I'm sorry to say we have not yet managed to catch this man in the act. Would you like an escort somewhere? This isn't the safest part of the city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are crew on the Antigoni. She is berthed in bay 21."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were on our way back from the shops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you wouldn't mind taking us there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be great!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He sketched a flourished bow. "Ladies, it would be my pleasure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Templar watched as they entered the ship, then watched a few minutes more, to be sure they really were attached to the ship. He was just turning away when the captain of the watch came up with two more men. "Brother Michaels, did you see two young women enter this section of the docks?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did, father Stevens. I escorted them here myself, after they had a run in with one of the local problems."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which ship are they attached to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Antigoni, berthed in number 21, just over there," Michaels replied, pointing to the Antigoni.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The group of men moved off, toward the open hatch, with Michaels trailing along. The leader stopped at the entrance andspoke loudly into the opening, "Excuse me. I am looking for the captain of this vessel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the captain arrived, she saw a group of Templars standing in the hatchway. "Pardon me ma'am, where might we find the captain of this ship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She couldn't quite hide the brief flicker of annoyance that crossed her face as she answered, "I am the captain. How may I help you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have a complaint sworn out that your engineering team is smuggling contraband. We would like to take a look through your ship," Stevens answered, with very little hesitation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mind spun frantically, this had been a clean trip. There shouldn't be anything for them to find. "I assume you have the correct paperwork?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes captain. We have the warrants here." He pulled out a small stack of papers and handed it to her. She thumbed through it verifying everything was in order.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very well. Come with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned and motioned them inside. "I'm sorry about this captain. We believe this tip to be completely unfounded, still, we do need to check them all out." She started toward the crew section. Completely unnerved she led the way to the crew ladder up to the quarters and living areas. Once there the squad leader motioned for his men to sit. "How was you trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How was my trip?" She mumbled, still in shock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain, I'm going to level with you. We have gotten complaints from this source before. Every time they have been a waste of our effort. I thought we'd sit, have a bit of a chat, and then we'd report back. Although, we could search your ship if that would make you feel better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, we can talk. That's fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless there's something we would find. In that case, maybe we should search..." He moved as if to stand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. You wouldn't find anything." She managed to say in a calm voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good. We may be Templars, but we aren't stupid. This port sees a fair share of illicit cargo. As long as it isn't flagrant or part of the slave trade, we aren't that concerned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The trip was fine. We had favorable weather and a good cargo for a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's good to hear. I am aware we aren't the most affluent city to trade with. I'm glad your two women made it back safely. They were involved in a bit of unpleasantness earlier. My unofficial guess is their assailant prompted this report. We believe this person is involved in child slavery, prostitution, and beggar gangs. No one that has been involved will testify however."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you need them to? I might be able to convince them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm not sure it would be enough. Some of the low-lifes here are quite influential. The system, well, it is the system, if you take my meaning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I fear I do. Some things just aren't easy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Templar glanced over at his men. "I think we've sat long enough. Head out and I will be down in a moment. I have a couple more formalities to clear up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But sir, regulations..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is ok. I don't think the crew of this ship poses a threat. I will be right down." Reluctantly his team stood and left. "Captain, I havesomething to ask, but Before I do, I want you to know I am not trying to trick or trap you. We are a small temple, quite a ways away from the politics and complications of temples closer to the old starport city. It allows us flexibility that we wouldn't have if we were closely monitored. It also causes supply and information shortages because the larger ships don't want to come here. I would like to contract with you to help us move things once in a while. The captain started to speak but the Templar held up his hand and went on, "Before you jump in, this won't involve anything particularly dangerous. Oncein a while it might bend the Templar rules a bit, but it would only be a problem in the starport city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be able to agree. Would this require me to interact with the priesthood?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it would be myself and one other only. You would be paid from discretionary funds, it would not be easily traced to you if something were to happen to us. I will introduce you to the other contact later. Right now I need to get back before one of the more rule-bound youngsters starts to wonder what we are doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I give it a little thought? You could return later tonight and I will have an answer. I am likely to say ok, but I do need to think on it," she added when he looked distressed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* RAW */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* back at the ship with the new one */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we found a great deal..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"on the new lens for the ship. You should see it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's really great. More power..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"better performance, and cheaper too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok. When will it be delivered?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's outside now..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we came back with it. Couldn't wait..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"to show you. Come on!" They pulled her along with them, back out to the dock. Pulled up next to the ship was a huge transport device with an enormous focusing lens held in a restraining cradle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain stopped and stared. "You can't be serious! That has to be enough for a small city. It won't ever fit in the ship. What the fuck were you thinking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All we have to do..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"is move a few things, ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"cut through a couple of decks, ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"and set it into place. You've always..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"been complaining we don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"have enough power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we do. And it was cheaper..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"than the replacement we were looking at."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain's shock was starting to wear off. It was replaced with warning bells. "What do you mean cheaper?" The twins exchanged nervous glances. "Out with it. What aren't you telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It isn't exactly..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is to say it wasn't quite..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, exactly..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Exactly what?" The captain's voice was low and deadly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a bit..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, abnormal. That is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it didn't meet the design specs..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for a floating platform anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take it back and get one that fits my ship!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, Missus Captain..." The captain's warning bells turned to deadly storm alarms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we, uh, we can't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we can't take it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was on close-out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"On special sale. Isn't it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"beautiful? And so much power. With only..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"a tiny little flaw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So tiny, it won't be dangerous."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well not really..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we know how to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"keep it balanced. It won't be a problem."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really, it won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me see if I understand. You spent good money on a flawed lens that we can't return? A lens that was designed for a small city? With a FLAW?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it's a tiny..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"little flaw, really. It'll be so good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can go anywhere,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"outrun anything. More power than we need."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And it didn't strike you at all strange that this wonderful, shiny new lens was so affordable?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No..well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"yes, but only at first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once we saw what the flaw was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we felt like we were cheating him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's minor..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"just an instability, well a fluctuation really..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"in the engery gathering part."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's easy to control. Not dangerous..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, dangerous if you're a moron..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"or don't see the magic right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem for us. And we can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"easily train the rest..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"of engineering to understand it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, maybe not the new guy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's a little slow magically. But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"since he only helps with the non-magic..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's no danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain's shoulders slumped in defeat. "I guess there's no way out of this. Draw up the plans and we'll add it to the refit." The twins grinned and ran to the ship, planning as they went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Current Events</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stood in the wheelhouse and stared out at the roiling sea of clouds. Her mind was almost as turbulent. This was the run. If everything went well they'd finally have enough cash to fix the ship with enough left over for the bribes necessary to get the better cargos. All they needed to do was get to port in the next day and contact the buyer. Once that was done they could dispose of the small trunk and be shut of the weird stranger that had brought it to them at the last minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* rethink this in terms of the arguement of religion - make sure it tracks the characters as they are evoloving, don't let it feel like they have dropped out of character - might be more subtle, might not be fully relevant in this form anymore,given better understanding of backgrounds and shared difficulties */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Better cargoes would mean more contact with the temples and religious order though. She gave an almost inaudible sigh. She knew she should just get over it and deal with them like everyone else. Still she couldn't help but feel dirty every time she did. But she wasn't just herself anymore. There were the ship and her crew to think about as well. If it meant stuffing her feelings a little deeper so they could be better off, she should be able to do it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Footsteps behind her drew her from her thoughts. She recognized them as belonging to the first mate. Before he could think she was contemplating mysteries she spoke, "Eight hours if the storms don't get worse. Twelve at the outside I can only hope..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The divine shall provide." he replied serenely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She choked back the usual desire to strangle him and commented, "Of course," in a neutral voice. She remembered how many times the 'divine' hadn't provided in the past.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad I found you I wanted to discuss..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't have time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Engineering is having some trouble." He continued as if she hadn't spoken.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry." She turned from the window, heart hammering, "What sort of troubles?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing that should delay us. Just more noises than usual from the main drives. They're talking additional parts, over the list they presented yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It doesn't sound like enough to hurt us too bad. Probably ten percent over the last requests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her heart slowed slightly. "I think we can manage for once."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, I'll let them know. You know, up here in all this beauty..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please don't. You know I won't listen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll keep trying though. It's my mission." She turned back to the view, listening as his footsteps moved away. 'Great, more costs.' Her mind ran over the figures again. There should still be enough, even with the latest. Her previous good mood was gone however. If the drives were making noise then something could still go wrong and stop them again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She heard light footsteps on the deck and turned as her junior officer arrived to take the watch. She forced a smile for the young woman and reported current ship status. "Thank you captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her smile turned genuine as the eager young woman took up station near steering. "See you later then. Call me if the weather deteriorates. With good luck it won't for a change." She walked slowly toward her cabin and her bunk. Some of the dark fears faded as she considered again what a find her junior officer had been. She was the youngest of the four girls in her family, which made her a marriage burden. No one had said much of anything when she had asked to join with the ship. The girl had been so eager to sign on that she hadn't seen the look of relief on her father's face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A tapping knock interrupted her preparations for sleep. Opening the door she was faced with the twins. "Heya captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hiya, captain, we just wanted to thank you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In advance..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For the chance to make proper repairs..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Although it's all her fault for not keeping that pseudo-science technology in proper order."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No it's not. It's your stupid structics. You never get them properly anchored and they torque the welds on the mounting points."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, if you learned a real science, like magic, you could fix those welds properly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you just did your job better..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All right you two, stop it." The captain tried. "Must you constantly argue?" She cringed as she realized she'd walked right into the trap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We wouldn't argue if she just did her job!" They both responded at once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm off watch and I haven't slept. You can thank me in a few hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we'll talk to you more..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Later." She watched them walk down the companionway toward engineering. They were the best engineering team she'd ever seen, yet they argued constantly. However, let anyone else challenge one of them, or insult the ship, and they would attack as a fighting pair until the enemy was an emotional blood pool on the deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had been another accidental find. She had been on a run to the edge cities, the poorest of the smaller cities. Her engineer had walked off with a snarled, "Dumb bitch. It's unmanly to work for a woman. I just took your job to get here." It wasn't much of a loss. He had only been able to fix a few of the smaller problems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned toward the dock master's office. There would be engineer notices posted, or at least references to the local guild. Maybe she could find a replacement that would work for the pittance she could afford.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her thoughts were broken as a pair of thin, ragged girls, shuffled up. Their eyes were downcast in the perfect subservience expected. "Missus Lady, where might we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"find your captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She struggled against the desire to snarl. "I am the captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two pairs of startled eyes jerked up to reveal dirty, hungry faces and shy smiles. "You are? Oh, that is so..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"wonderful! Would you let us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"fix things on your ship? We would..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"do engineering work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a long pause before the other one added, "Or food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please Missus Captain. She knows the magic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And she knows the technology. We work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for cheap. Only enough to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hush, she doesn't need to know that!" one of them hissed in warning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain thought for long moments. Long enough for the girls to start shuffling from foot to foot, before she replied, "You can take a look. There are some minor things I could use done." Bright smiles greeted her announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took them aboard and led the way to engineering. She stood in the hatchway and watched as they quickly assessed the equipment. Muttered comments floated between them in the curious way they had. At last one looked up and listed off what the problems were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"By all means, please fix them." They were quicker and more thorough than her last engineer had been. They also cleaned up after themselves when they were finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now Missus Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if you could please pay us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we will be on our way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One moment. Whom do you work for?" They looked guiltily between each other, but didn't respond. "You can tell me. I might want to hire you if the price is right." Two brilliant smiles greeted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, don't worry about that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles dimmed. They looked at each other before one answered, "We work for a beggar chief. He sends us out and feeds us if we bring back money. Otherwise he shuts us in a dark room until the next day when we must try again." The other stood eyes searching the deck, refusing to meet the captain's look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, look, I can't pay you much. It would come to maybe the wage of a single journeyman's apprentice in the guild pay tables, but it's yours if you want it. I offer it in exchange for engineering services. This is the standard offer of at will employment. You may quit at any port, although prior notice would be appreciated. I can terminate your employment at will as well. Your duties will be the maintenance and upkeep of the magical and technological systems on this ship. Room and board come standard with this agreement. I have a small crew. It will be myself, the two of you, and my first mate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Standard contract..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you think?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think we take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To the hells with him. If he doesn't like it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"he can go to the authorities!" They both laughed, then answered as one, "We'd love to Missus Captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And one other thing. It's not Missus Captain. It's just captain. I will not be bound to a husband."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When do we.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"start? M... uh...Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Immediately. I will be here for a day, maybe two, arranging cargo. We leave once it is loaded. Get your things and be ready. You can move into your bunk space as soon as you wish." She pointed to the small cabin off the engineering space. "I'd offer you better, but there really isn't any."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They darted over, surveyed the space, whistling appreciatively all the while. "It's great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A real door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Real beds!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's lovely, M..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain tried to see the cramped space, barely large enough for the bunks, a miniature table, wall lockers, and a chair, with the same eyes as the girls. The hatch still showed the blast marks from the time the drives had blown up on the previous owner. She squinted and tried harder, trying to imagine the spaces they must be used to for this to be a palace. Finally she shook her head and gave up. "Glad you like it, because it's all I can offer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had been priceless from that day forward, keeping the ship running when any other engineer would have run screaming. Slowly she was able to increase their pay as she had been able to make more runs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The remeberances helped her to calm her mind enough to grab a few hours sleep before the next meal. Rising almost refreshed she was able to enjoy some of the food the first mate had cooked. As the day wore on her fears clawed their way to the front again. She paced to the wheelhouse and stared into the clouds. The storms had calmed and the bright sun shone on a puffy sea of cotton white. It was one of the rare beautiful days that made running an air ship wonderful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to her junior officer and almost said they were going to be ok. Then a life time of superstitions closed her mouth. Instead she commented on the beauty outside. She recieved an answering smile in return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate came in and relieved the junior officer. For a time they all remained lost in their own thoughts. The junior officer left shortly after they saw the first flashes of light off the towers of the city in the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they approached the giant floating city slowly resolved itself. Delicate looking, magically enhanced floatation bubbles refracted the sunlight into a rainbow of color that splashed down on the spires and cubes of the living areas. A thick under section, hidden mostly in the top layers of the lower clouds, housed the support facilities for the populace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate silently turned the wheel over to the captain as they approached the city. She skillfully eased the ship closer, losing elevation as she approached. When they reached the right point she slowly moved forwared, into the tangle of docks, warehouses, and other support structures of the port. Their target dock was deep in the tangle of private company facilities. At the marker specified by their contractor she adjusted her lift to slowly rise to the level of the assigned station. Once the ship was positioned she slowly dropped the boyancy until the ship settled into the cradle. She continued to drop boyancy until the ship would remain in the cradle even after the cargo was removed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Their contact met the captain at the base of the gangway. "Right on time. Most excellent! Let me take a quick look at the cargo and then I'll get the unloaders on it." He followed her into the hold and rapidly scanned the crates. Every so often he would wave a hand scanning device over a crate and consult its information. At last he nodded, smiled, and handed the captain a credit structic. "It's all there, just as we agreed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. It's been a pleasure!" She smiled and escorted him back to the gangway. He waved at a forman standing in the doorway of the attached warehouse. The man nodded and motioned inside. A crew of unloaders with equipment filed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we can start planning our future. Tell the rest of the crew it's bar time. We need to cellebrate a little and plan a lot! The first round is on the ship." The mate returned her smile with one of his own as he headed for the crew section. "Clud Kissers Tavern, everyone is to attend. We leave now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They arrived as a laughing, high spirited group. Quickly they commandeered a large booth and the captain ordered a round of expensive Glarvez Fizz, a sparkling fermented glarvez grain beverage, favored when celebrating good fortune. "To us and our future!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat and talked, drank, and ate. Every so often a bit of the news from the data feeds around the bar would catch their attention. It wouldn't hold it for long, though. Not until an almost familiar face appeared in the feed. "Today this man was arrested on charges of heresy. He was charged with transporting and attempting to sell heretical materials. All persons connected with him are being sought for questioning. If you have seen associates of this man, or have had dealings with him in any way, please report to the nearest temple offices for questioning. Remember, it is bad karma and a civil offense to aid in the distribution of heresy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation stopped dead for a brief second before their survival instincts took over. Their forced laughter and conversation would have been believable to anyone other than a trained temple agent. Slowly they drifted away, one at a time, over the next half hour. The captain was the last to leave because she needed to settle the bill on the way out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at the ship she found them all in the galley. They were engaged in sporadic conversation about what to do and what had happened. "He won't last long. They never do under temple questioning," the mate was saying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it, this time I thought we had made it. I should have been more suspicious, but he paid the right amount and appeared legitimate. It seemed like just what he said, a box of family items from his dead uncle," the captain added. Conversation lapsed again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"see what this package..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"is. Before we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"get in trouble for it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain walked swiftly to the hold, grabbed the wooden box in question, brought it back to the galley, and set it down on the table. It was simple work to pry the lid up. Inside a nest of custom contoured packing was a large leather bound book. The leather was old and cracked. Small brass locks held aged straps in place. Over it a metal webbing had been wrapped and sealed with a complicated magic lock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins looked at the lock. "Wow, that's really cool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Complicated though. I think I could open it like..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No dumb ass, look there. See the way the metal webbing is folded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right smart mouth, an embedded trap," Anta snapped back. Emly ran to engineering, grabbed a pair of small pliars, and held the webbing still while the magical one probed the lock. After a few minutes she said, "This will take some time but I'm sure I can open it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation started up around the captain, however she didn't notice. Her world crashed in on her again. Once more her dream of good cargo and honest patrons vanished in a puff of smoke. The credits in the structic were a princely sum compared to their usual take, but it wouldn't last long. Not after the repairs they needed and under general expenses. Her thoughts turned to the repairs. The mate was right, their contact wouldn't last long. They would have maybe a day before the templars would be down here dragging them in for questioning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was no answering twin voice to finish the thought. Her head jerked up to see them staring in wonder at the open book. "Well, are we talking heresy or ultimate heresy? Does it say god is really a turd in the cosmic sewer?" She ignored the hissed breath from her first mate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No Missus Captain..." The use of the old term told more of their surprise than the slow voice had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's a magic treatise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A very old one. Full of academic magic research."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She understands some of it though!" Emly said proudly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is that heresy?" her junior officer asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not. It means the temple wants this very badly. They will be even more ruthless now. We have only two choices. Abandon the ship, disappear into the city, and become warf rats. Or, we take the ship and run, returning to shadow cargo and always looking over our shoulders," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't go back to begging Missus Captain," Emly said</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't either," said Anta, looking up from the book.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That leaves the two of you," the captain said. "I won't abandon my ship. I can give you time to leave if you want it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate looked offended, "I can't believe you thought I'd run out on you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't. But I know the temple means a lot to you. You might be able to miss some of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nievete doesn't become you. Once they trace the book to this ship I'm in as deep as you. I am not leaving."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Better what I know than begging," the junior officer added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So we run. Engineering, what do we have to fix before we go? How long will it take to get what you need and get it in place? We are ok on consumables, however, if we can replace what we've used quickly, we should."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We gave a list..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"to the first. It is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"enough to keep us going." The twins returned to examining the book. "Oh, and please..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"pick up some fresh items..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"the first has the list. It's..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"our turn to make dinner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain shrugged and headed toward the dock. The first mate followed behind. It took several hours to order all the desired items and arrange for them to be delivered to the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were met at the entrance to the docks by temple and civilian police. "Evening Captain," one of them began, looking at the first mate even as the words addressed her. "We were wondering if you might have seen this person," he produced an image of the contact they were supposed to meet, "at any time since your arrival. We expect he will be hanging around the docks to pick up a shipment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She clamped down on her racing heart. The mate remained stoic as well. "No officer, we haven't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think law abiding citizens such as yourselves would have. However, if you see him, be sure to let us know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We've not been here long. Might I ask what he did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is suspected of trafficking in heretical materials. In specific he is linked to the offering for sale of some extremely sensitive items. We expect to bring in several known heretics later tonight for questioning. He will be one of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once they were out of sight the mate asked, "How long you think we have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't say. It's a fine line. We don't wait long enough and they'll chase us as soon as we leave, certain that we know something. If we wait too long they'll break our contact and have us for sure. My best guess is we wait for the supplies and hope to slip out then." They hurried along as casually as they could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do we tell the crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they already know we have to run." She strode along in silence for a few moments. "Damn, back to the edge trade." The captain shook her head in disappointment. "As soon as our supplies arrive I want to be out of here. Make up something about a better cargo offer in the next city to get us clear of the docks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins were still in the galley staring at the book. The second was staring moodily into a cup of tea. The captain poured herself a cup and sat down. Soon she had joined the second in staring into her own cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need more books." Emly suddenly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is amazing..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's a book on experimental..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"magic. High powered stuff..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we don't understand much of it yet..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we need more magic theory books." They bent their heads back to the book in front of them and began muttering to themselves in the curious shortcut language they used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do those even exist anymore?" the second asked. "I thought that was mostly legend from the old times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, there are still some around. Possession will brand you heretic faster than just about anything else though. I never really knew why," the captain explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone knows magic flows from god, as a gift to his people. It wasn't to be taken apart and fiddled with. If the people of the first world, Torestre, had respected the god and the magic, the cleansing plague would not have been required."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I love how religion rewrites history. The plague was caused by the refined enhancement drug we sent them. Every colony in the system benefitted from the study of magic as science. It's only recently that this crazed notion of magic as god-given has come into vogue," the captain commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it weren't my mission to bring you from your heathen ways, I'd have to turn you in as a heretic, captain," the first said almost bitterly. "I've warned you before about that kind of talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you'll notice I save it for when I'm safely on my ship, mostly anyway. I don't want to be hauled away like my uncle was."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Quite the scandal, if I remember. Didn't your uncle refuse to implicate the rest of your family, even though it was known they were teaching heresies to their children?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you always remind me? You know it doesn't help your goals."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I just can't help it. They were teaching you such preposterous rubish. Sad part is it could make sense, if it were true."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If what were true, Missus Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The, stories, my parents told me about the way things were before the plague. The plague was caused by human factors in their stories. Some 'god' sitting in the depths of wherever had nothing to do with it." Once again she stopped short of mentioning the precious books, still hidden in the twisting passsages below her parents residence. For years she and her first had the same argument, and on more than one occassion he could have turned her in. He never did, regardless of what she had said in his presence. It took the real anger out of their arguments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At least she assumed the books would still be under her parents place. After the city had been found floating and empty, she hadn't gone back. There had been an investigation but nothing conclusive had ever been found. The city had followed one of the downward currents deeper into the clouds, searching for elusive resources. It had been empty when it floated back to the normal levels. There was no sign of raiding or combat and no sign of any of the citizens. A full investigation was launched but nothing was ever found. In time, a few brave families had moved in to try and rebuild, but they never really thrived.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her thoughts were interrupted by Anta saying, "Stories..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean like from..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...forbidden books and such? Cuz we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...know where books can be found." The captain threw a sharp look at her first. He was staring at the twins as if they had grown more heads.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta, oblivious to his look, continued, "Course we do. Our city, Agtathryl,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...yeah, the one you rescued us at..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Quiet, I'm telling her," Anta interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're telling her too slow," Emly shot back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our city has booksellers..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They know the old stuff..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...booksellers that can get them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should go there!" Emly suggested. "Maybe they have magic books..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure they do bolt fingers. That's why I ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking of going there anyway," the captain interrupted. "We have friends there. And we know they aren't very friendly to this city." The first started to say something, changed his mind, and remained silent. "Emly, Anta, will you be able to make your repairs while we are in the air?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not as easily, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"... better than getting caught."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When will we have the supplies?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In an hour or two according to the suppliers. Provisions should arrive around the same time. Then we go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They spent a nervous two hours waiting for the supplies to arrive. They were quickly loaded and then the captain requested detparture clearances. For long moments the dispatcher hesitated, finally coming back with the ok. She didn't relax until they were clear of the city and heading into a thicker cloud bank. It meant a greater chance of storm and heavy weather, but it would make them harder to track.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain had just begun to believe they had gotten away clean when Emly walked up to her. "We've detected trackers in our supplies. There are at least three of them causing strange distortions in the lens. That's how we knew. Anta is devising a way to neutralize them so we can dump them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait! If we neutralize them and drop them toward the floor, they will know immediately. If they're really serious they could consider desperate measures, triangulate, and take us in the clouds. It would be better to go to a somewhat friendly port and dump them there. That way it looks like we are staying for a while. It gives us more options for misleading them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly turned pale, "Right, I'll tell Anta right away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain grabbed the speaking tube, "First mate to the bridge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Change of plans. The twins have found tracking devices on board. I want us to make a slow change in direction toward Fedsrathian. I don't want our persuers to follow us to a friendly place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our course change will seem a bit odd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't be helped. I don't want them to know we have friends at Agtathryl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, starting the correction now. Heading to engineering?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes" She found the twins intently studying several distortions in the lens. "Are there more than the three you are seeing there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"... Anta's studying the patterns..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...there might be another mixed in with our repair items."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emly relayed my concerns didn't she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I have neutralizers..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But now she will wait..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Until we reach a port."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much time will you need to get the trackers off the ship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The two looked at each other and spoke in single words for a few seconds. "An hour should be enough," Anta replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Expecting trouble?" Emly asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The way our luck runs, yes," the captain replied. "How are the repairs going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should be finished in a few more hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything is going well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They sold us good quality parts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the first time I've heard of a lens detecting other magic items. Is this common?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it takes a specific kind of matrix, one that isn't put into standard equipment," Anta replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you know about this when you found this lens?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, captain," Emly replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Magic books would help understand our lens," Anta added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They changed course in a long, wide turn. After several hours finally pointing to their new destination. Slowly they eased their way into the common docks. "Captain?" the first office spoke from the door to the bridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" she replied, her stomach lurching at the seriousness of his expression.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was checking the city news as we approached. The local political scene has shifted to a far more orthodox view recently. We have to expect the Temple has gotten messages here ahead of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How dangerous do think this will be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They've had our contact for thirty-six hours. Most people break between thirty-six and forty-eight hours. We should make this a very quick stop. Maybe order a few simple supplies and get out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Agreed. I'll let engineering know. Could you take care of the orders?" the captain replied. He nodded and headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made her way down the narrow passages back to engineering, where the twins were peering into an open crate. "Any luck? Will you be able to get rid of these things in an hour or less?"</p>
