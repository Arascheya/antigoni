<p class="pagecaption">Prelate Martin Stevens</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Martin lives on Agtathryl. He was born on Zerethaasa with his sister. He has a niece, <a href="andya.htm">Andya</a> who is part of the Antigoni crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Martin is the Prelate on Agtathryl. He is a very devout man, but he struggles with the secular rules the Temple is imposing. The latest version of the Council of Brethren has decided that the Temple must become the only religion for all the cities. They will resort to any means necessary to achieve this. Martin is violently opposed to this.</p>
