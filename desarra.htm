<p class="pagecaption">D'Esarra</p>
<p class="regtxt5">D'Esarra has been with <ahref="janya.htm">J'Anya</a> since she acquired the Antigoni. She came from the same city as J'Anya and is deeply scarred by the loss of the city. D'Esarra is fiercely loyal to the captain and the first officer. She is suspicious of <a href="zethara.htm">Zethara</a> since she overheard something odd at a recent port call.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her main function is weapons officer, but she is also a capable engineer. She was able to handle basic needs to get Antigoni to a city for repairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is the opposite of Ashtanna in terms of body image. When the ship is in the air, she wears the least amount of clothing needed to be decent. She will dress in elegant and perfect clothes when city-side. She appears cold and distant to avoid having to talk to anyone. She will not answer any questions about T'Azjahdrath, regardless of who asks.</p>
